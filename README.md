# markov-text-chain

## The Project

Since university, I have been fascinated by Markov Chains and always thought that it would be a fun challenge to try and program one myself. I went for a text chain because I wanted to see what the simplest generative AI I could make with a markov chain was. This repository contains the code for the markov text chain under the src folder, and uses pytest in the tests folder to conduct some simple logical tests on the program.
